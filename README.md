Any student looking to borrow code should remember their course's Academic Honesty Policy and reconsider looking further at the source-code. It is worth more to you to learn programming the hard way than to cheat! Check out the official Python documentation, post a question on the CS50 Ed Discussion board, visit StackOverflow... or just take a break for a while!</details></p>*
